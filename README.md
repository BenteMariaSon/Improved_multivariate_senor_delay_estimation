# Improved_multivariate_senor_delay_estimation

These functions were used to estimate the time delays between sensor data of an industrial process.
Methodology is described in: Van Son, B., Offermans, T., Bertinetto, C. G., & Jansen, J. J. (2024). Improved multivariate sensor delay estimation using a hierarchical clustering-based approach. Chemometrics And Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 105306. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2024.105306.

The demonstration.m file contains an example of how the functions can be used with randomly generated data. 

### Code writers
